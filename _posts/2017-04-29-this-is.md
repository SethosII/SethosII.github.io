![This is Linux](/images/sparta-tux.svg)

This drawing is an adaptation of the [original Tux](http://www.home.unix-ag.org/simon/penguin/) by Larry Ewing and Simon Budig to the glorious Spartans. It is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Feel free to improve it, as I'm not the greatest artist (as one might see ...).

You can also find it on [Spreadshirt](https://www.spreadshirt.de/this+is+linux-A104562236?productType=812&appearance=231), but they didn't want to offer it without the copyright notice, which I find quite ugly. However I got my own shirt without the notice by just uploading it as my own design.
